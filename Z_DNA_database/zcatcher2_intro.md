Due to experimental methods are not effective to localize Z-DNA fragments in the genome. Consequently, We developed a computational methods to predict Z-DNA forming regions(**ZDRs**) using a rigorous thermodynamic search strategy.
  
  
  *Z-Catcher2*, an upgrade version of *Z-Catcher*^[1,2], is a PERL program for predicting potential ZDRs in the input sequences or whole chromosomes of special organism genome. The program scans the input DNA fragment or a whole chromosome and predicts ZDRs as long as possible. We used *Z-Cather2* to Model Organism genomes (*Mouse, Rattus, Zebrafish, FruitFly, Celegans, Saccerevisiae, Arabidopsis*) and *Human*, *Chimpanzee* genomes and obtained ZDRs in these species. This website demostrates the current results and provides services to download the results and *Z-Catcher2* program.
