
  The left-handed structure of a DNA fragment has a zigzag arrangement of the sugar-phosphate backbone, which was named as Z-DNA and it has benn deduced from X-ray studies of alternated oligonucleotides poly(dC-dG).^[1] In a Z-DNA framgment, every other base is rotated around the glycosydic bond after the reorganization, so that the bases are in the alternating *anti-* (purine residues, A and G) and *syn-*(pyrimidine residues, T and C) conformations along the chain.^[2] Instead of having a helix with both major and minor grooves, a Z-DNA has only one type of grooves which is analogous to the minor grooves in B-DNA, and the Z-DNA base pairs are set off to the side, away from the axis.^[3]
  
  
  These Z-DNAs widely distribute in the Human Genome and other Model Organisms. Z-DNAs may effect on  genes transcription and DNA recombination because of ZDRs enriched in the regions of Transcriptional start sites(**TSSs**). They also lead to the kind of genetic instability associated with cancers such as leukemia and lymphoma.^[4] In bacterial cells, the Z-DNA caused small deletions or insertions of on or two DNA bases. But in huamn cells, the inroduced Z-DNA led to large-scale deletions and rearrangements of the DNA molecule.^[5] These results suggested Z-DNA may promte DNA damage.
